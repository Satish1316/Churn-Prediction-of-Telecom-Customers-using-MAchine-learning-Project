# Churn Prediction of Telecom Customers

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn in the telecom industry using machine learning techniques. Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers stop using a companyâ€™s services. Predicting churn helps telecom companies proactively identify customers at risk of leaving, allowing them to improve customer retention strategies.

## Dataset
The dataset contains the following key information about telecom customers:

| Column             | Description                                      |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| CustomerID         | Unique identifier for each customer               |
| Gender             | Male or Female                                    |
| Age                | Age of the customer                               |
| MonthlyCharges     | Monthly charges for the customer                  |
| TotalCharges       | Total charges for the customer                    |
| Churn              | Whether the customer has churned or not           |

## Project Structure
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations are used to explore customer demographics and churn behavior, including factors such as age, monthly charges, and total charges. A correlation matrix is generated to understand feature relationships.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Missing values are handled, categorical features are encoded, and oversampling using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) is applied to address class imbalance.
3. **Feature Scaling**: Numerical features (e.g., MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges) are scaled to ensure consistent ranges before model training.
4. **Model Building**: Several machine learning models are implemented to predict customer churn, including:
   - Decision Tree Classifier
   - Random Forest Classifier
   - XGBoost Classifier
5. **Model Evaluation**: The models are evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports to compare performance.
6. **Cross-Validation**: Cross-validation is used to ensure the reliability and stability of the models.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Encoding of categorical variables, handling of missing data, and SMOTE for class balancing.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implementation of multiple models for churn prediction (Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost).
- **Model Evaluation**: Comparison of model accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification metrics to identify the best-performing model.
- **Cross-Validation**: Applied to improve model reliability and performance.

## Insights and Recommendations
The churn prediction models provide insights into customer behavior and churn risk. Based on model outputs, the following strategies can be employed to reduce churn:

| Insight         | Business Strategy                                                    |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| High churn risk among customers with high monthly charges | Implement targeted retention offers, discounts, or loyalty programs to retain these customers. |
| Customers with longer tenure are less likely to churn | Strengthen long-term engagement strategies, such as personalized offers or rewards for loyal customers. |
| Senior customers are more likely to churn | Develop support programs or tailored services to improve satisfaction among senior customers. |

## Future Work
- Implement additional models such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) or Logistic Regression for further analysis.
- Experiment with feature engineering to derive new insights from the dataset.
- Develop a Power BI dashboard to provide an interactive experience for exploring churn predictions and insights.
